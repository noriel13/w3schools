# Programming Concepts Cheat sheet

## known library
type() this function allows you to identify the specific data type you are working with 
len()   this function gives you the size of a ordered collection type
## Variables
variables are vesels that are used to contain value(s)


## Data Types

DATA TYPE       CONVERSION / CASTING
integers        int()
strings         str()
booleans        bool()
floats          float()
lists           list()
tuple           tuple()
sets            set()
dictionaries    dict()

# Strings
str()
name = "Noriel"
### Indexing

name[2]     [] together with a number will allow you to acces a specific portion of a variable's value

### Slicing
name[1:]        slicing allows you to gather information from a variable from a specified range 
name[start:stop:step]       default postions[0:-1,1]
name[::-1]      this is great for reversing strings and lists
# Booleans
truthy = any string that isnt empty. any number that isnt "0" and True
falsy = any string that is empty. only Zero. False and None

# Operators
Arithmetic operators
Assignment operators
Comparison operators
Logical operators
Identity operators
Membership operators
 
# Lists
List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
list[]

# Tuples
Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
tuple()

# Sets
Set is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. No duplicate members.
set{}

# Dictionaries
Dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed. No duplicate members.
dict{:}     key:value  considered key value pairs

# If/Else
Equals: a == b
Not Equals: a != b
Less than: a < b
Less than or equal to: a <= b
Greater than: a > b
Greater than or equal to: a >= b

# While loops
best used in looping in indefinite amount 
# For loops
best used for looping a definite amount
# Functions
functions will always return a value. the default is the None data type
# Lambda
single line functions
    lambda args: body w/o return
# Arrays
